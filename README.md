# Haptic Sound

This app, exclusively available on MacOS(coming soon to windows ok) allows for the system audio to vibrate a connected Xbox controller. This allows for a more immersive experience on both music and movies.

It uses tkinter, and a dodgy connection to a run subprocess that is compiled swift code.
